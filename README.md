# Photo Gallery

## Overview
This is a simple **Photo Gallery** web application that allows users to view, filter, and upload images categorized under Nature, Architecture, and Animals. The gallery features a lightbox view for image enlargement and a category filter to display specific types of photos. Users can also upload their own images into the gallery.

## Features
- Dynamic Image Gallery: The gallery displays a set of predefined images and allows dynamic filtering by categories such as Nature, Architecture, and Animals.
- Category Filter: Buttons allow users to filter the images based on the selected category or view all images at once.
- Lightbox Feature: Clicking on any image enlarges it in a modal-style lightbox.
- Image Upload: Users can upload their own images, select a category, and have them displayed in the gallery.
  
## Technologies Used
- HTML5: Structure of the webpage
- CSS3: For styling the gallery, buttons, lightbox, and layout
- JavaScript: For dynamically updating the gallery, filtering images by category, handling the lightbox feature, and processing image uploads
